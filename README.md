# gsap-dev-talk
This is a project I created as part of my dev talk called, "GreenSock It To Me". It was used as an introduction to GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). GSAP is an extremely powerful Javascript library for creating complex animations.

This app is written in Angular and presents a particular way to organize and create animations for different pages/components.

There is a "details" page at the end of the application that has no animations yet - it is styled and ready to go. Use it as a playground to start creating your very own animations with GSAP.
